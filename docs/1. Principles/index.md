# 1.0. Principles

Even with powerful tools like Python, analyses, processes, and models can easily become overly complicated. Python makes it possible to build workflows that are easier to manage, but achieving this requires deliberate design and thoughtful application of best practices.  

This chapter introduces the key principles that make Python projects effective in real-world pricing teams: transparency, automation, modularity, and collaboration between technical and non-technical colleagues.  

By embedding these principles into your workflows, you can increase efficiency, enhance auditability, and maximise the impact of your work.
