# 5.3. Deployment

How to deploy machine learning models is dependant on what your current deployment solution supports.

# Offline / Batch Scoring

By scoring data offline, there is no deployment neccessary which makes utilising machine learning much easier, however likely to be less effective. 

Offline scoring can be used to create classification files, such as postcode or vehicle, or as inputs to an offline optimisation framework which produces relativities.

# PMML

PMML is a popular option for deployment in popular rating software. This involves taking a model and converting to a PMML file and importing this into your rating engine. 

This also requires manipulating the PMML in order to work within the software.

Requires specific libraries

Brittle

Manual deployment

# APIs

Typical approach outside of insurance when live scoring is required. 

Recommended approach for building your pricing as a system. Automated deployment should always be the preferred option, even if there needs to be be a manual review.
