# 1.1. System design

Designing analytical systems thoughtfully ensures they are reliable, maintainable, and scalable over time. Good system design helps keep your work transparent, efficient, and easier to debug.

### Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

A core principle in system design is to model workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Each node represents a distinct task or computation, and edges define dependencies.

- DAGs ensure no circular dependencies, making execution order clear  
- Tasks run only when dependencies are met, avoiding redundant work  
- This clarity helps maintain reproducibility and simplifies debugging

### Keep It Simple

Simplicity is key. Avoid over-engineering.

- Break down complex problems into small, manageable components  
- Write clear, concise code with a single responsibility per module or function  
- Simple systems are easier to maintain, test, and extend

### Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Avoid duplicating code or logic.

- Create reusable functions or classes for common tasks  
- Share components across different projects or pipelines  
- Reduces the risk of inconsistencies and errors

### Configuration Management

Separating configuration from code is crucial.

- Store parameters like file paths, thresholds, and environment settings outside your codebase (e.g., config files, environment variables)  
- This allows easy adjustments without modifying core code  
- Supports multiple environments (development, testing, production) without code changes  
- Improves reproducibility and collaboration by clearly defining runtime settings
