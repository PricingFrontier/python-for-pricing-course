# 5. Machine Learning

Machine learning is no longer a luxury in pricing-it’s a competitive advantage. This chapter introduces modelling pipelines, training and validating models, and applying them to real-world pricing problems. You’ll also learn the essentials of deploying models and monitoring their performance over time.

- **[5.0. Modelling Pipelines](./5.0. Modelling Pipelines.md)**:  
  Build efficient, repeatable pipelines to prepare data, train models, and generate predictions.

- **[5.1. Training & Validation](./5.1. Training & Validation.md)**:  
  Learn best practices for training models and validating their performance to ensure reliability.

- **[5.2. Model Registries](./5.2. Model Registries.md)**:  
  Manage model versions and metadata to track development and facilitate collaboration.

- **[5.3. Deployment](./5.3. Deployment.md)**:  
  Explore how to deploy models into production environments for real-world pricing decisions.

- **[5.4. Monitoring](./5.4. Monitoring.md)**:  
  Set up monitoring to detect model drift, performance degradation, and maintain model accuracy over time.
