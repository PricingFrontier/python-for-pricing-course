# 5.0. Machine Learning

Machine learning is no longer a luxury in pricing-it’s a competitive advantage. This chapter introduces modelling pipelines, training and validating models, and applying them to real-world pricing problems. You’ll also learn the essentials of deploying models and monitoring their performance over time.

Build efficient, repeatable pipelines to prepare data, train models, and generate predictions.

Learn best practices for training models and validating their performance to ensure reliability.

Manage model versions and metadata to track development and facilitate collaboration.

Explore how to deploy models into production environments for real-world pricing decisions.

Set up monitoring to detect model drift, performance degradation, and maintain model accuracy over time.
