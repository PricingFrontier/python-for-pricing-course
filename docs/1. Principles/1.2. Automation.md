# 1.2. Automation

Automation

Insurance pricing teams have a lot of tolerance for doing manual and mundane tasks.

It is possible to automate the majority of pricing tasks, in some cases it may be preferable to keep a manual validation step, but any data processing, reporting or other mundane tasks should be automated.

##Data pipelines

Any pipelines for modelling or analysis can be automated - data is automatic up until the point it reaches pricing teams where things generally become manual.

Rather than batches, incrementally processing data and inserting on a daily basis allows pricing teams to always have data ready to go.

##Reporting

Often the task handed to interns and graduates. As with data pipelines, data for these can be automatic. And then either a dashboarding software such as PowerBI or a python library like Plotly Dash for displaying. 

If the output is to be emailed, libraries such as Send grid cab be used for.
