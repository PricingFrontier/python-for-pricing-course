# 3.2. Libraries

### What are Python Libraries?
A Python library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality so you donâ€™t have to write everything from scratch.  
They can include:

- **Functions** (e.g., `sum()`, `mean()`)

- **Classes** (e.g., `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn)

- **Datasets** (e.g., sample data for testing)

- **Tools** for specialised tasks like data analysis, visualisation, machine learning, or file handling.

Examples:
- **pandas** - data manipulation and analysis.

- **numpy** - numerical computing.

- **matplotlib** - basic charting.

- **scikit-learn** - machine learning.

### Why use Python Libraries?

1. **Save Time**  
   No need to reinvent the wheel - use existing, tested code.

2. **Increase Reliability**  
   Popular libraries are maintained by large communities and tested across many environments.

3. **Focus on Analysis, Not Plumbing**  
   Instead of building your own CSV reader, use `pandas.read_csv()` and spend your time interpreting results.

4. **Access Advanced Tools Easily**  
   Complex statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and visualisations are just a few lines of code away.
