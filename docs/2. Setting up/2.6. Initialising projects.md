# 2.6. Initialising a project

## Setup repository

1. In Github, click the + icon in the top right and select new repository.

2. Give your repository a name and a description. 

3. Select whether it's private or public (can be changed).

4. Toggle README which creates a markdown file which will be displayed when viewing the repository.

5. Select python from the .gitignore, this is a default list of files and extensions to not include in the repository.

6. Add a licence if needed.

7. Open VSCode (connect to WSL if installed), and select clone repository, navigate to where you want your project to be saved.

## Create virtual environment

In the terminal:

Initialise uv:

```pwsh-session
uv init
```

Create a virtual environment:

```pwsh-session
uv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```pwsh-session
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now the virtual environment is activated any libraries installed will be in this environment.

You can install libararies using 'uv add {package name}':

```pwsh-session
uv add polars
```

This will install the polars libarary and update the pyproject.toml file with the package.
