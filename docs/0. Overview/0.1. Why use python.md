# 0.1. Why use Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world - especially in data analytics.  

It is a high-level, general-purpose language known for its ease of use, readability, and huge ecosystem of libraries.

## How can Python help our pricing workflows?

For nearly a decade, Python has been a staple in analytics teams across many industries. This has led to the development of a vast number of tools and libraries designed specifically for analytical purposes.  

In insurance pricing, however, Excel and closed-source software remain dominant. This often means analysis and processes are built on an ad-hoc basis, relying on many manual steps.

Python changes this by allowing you to:

- Build reproducible analytics - ensuring results can be easily re-run and verified.
- Develop pricing infrastructure as a system, not just a series of one-off analyses.
- Innovate - exploring the latest advancements in data science and analytics, which is rarely possible if your team relies solely on Excel or proprietary software.

## Isn't Excel the perfect tool for analysis?

While Excel is extremely common and familiar, it often leads to the following scenarios:

- Teams spending more time cleaning and processing data than analysing it.
- Processes involving extensive manual work and copy-pasting.
- Projects that take months to complete but cannot be reproduced or reused.
- Work that cannot be refreshed with new data or additional factors.
- Spreadsheets so complex only the original creator can run them.
- Debugging that requires tracing through individual cells.
- Reports being run manually rather than automatically.

By contrast, Python - combined with good engineering practices (covered in this course) - allows you to:

- Build reusable components that can be shared across different pricing processes.
- Improve auditability and quality through automation.
- Productionise processes so they run automatically, freeing analysts to focus on deeper insights and infrastructure improvements.
- Apply proven software engineering concepts like automated testing, continuous deployment, and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) to reduce errors.

## What about paid software?

There’s always a trade-off between building your own solutions and buying commercial tools. In insurance pricing, the choice often exists, but many teams spend hundreds of thousands - even millions - on software when a more flexible, higher-quality solution could be built using free, open-source tools.

This course is not about debating the pros and cons of commercial software, but about showing how Python can match (and often exceed) these capabilities without the heavy licensing costs.

## Side effects of learning to code

Programming is more than just learning syntax. It teaches:

- Good system design.
- Thinking ahead about maintenance.
- Writing code that others can understand and adapt.

These skills apply beyond Python - they make you a better pricing analyst in Excel or closed-source tools too.

## Why Python instead of R?

For many analytical tasks, if one language can do it, so can the other. However:

- Python’s popularity means a wider selection of libraries and faster adoption of new methods.
- When building systems that integrate with other tools, Python is almost always better supported.

For example:  
- SendGrid, a popular email automation service, supports Python but not R.  
- Azure Functions, a common choice for running code in the cloud, supports Python but not R.

In short, Python’s ecosystem makes it the more versatile choice for integrating analytics into production systems.
