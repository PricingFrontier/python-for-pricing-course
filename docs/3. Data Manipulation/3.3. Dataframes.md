# 3.3. Dataframes

Polars is a fast DataFrame library designed for working with large datasets efficiently.  
If youâ€™ve used Excel or Pandas before, Polars will feel familiar but offers much better performance - especially for large insurance datasets like quotes, claims, and policy records.

## Why Use Polars?

- **Performance** - Built in Rust, Polars can handle millions of rows quickly.
- **Memory Efficiency** - Uses less RAM than Pandas for the same data.
- **Lazy Evaluation** - Can defer calculations until needed, optimising execution.
- **Clear Syntax** - Easy to read, even for beginners.

For insurance pricing teams, this means you can analyse millions of quotes without Excel grinding to a halt.

## Creating a DataFrame

You can create a DataFrame directly from Python data or by reading a file.

```python
import polars as pl

# Example: Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
df = pl.DataFrame({
    "policy_id": [101, 102, 103, 104],
    "base_premium": [500, 650, 420, 700],
    "risk_factor": [1.15, 1.05, 1.30, 0.95],
    "has_claim_history": [False, True, False, True]
})

print(df)
