# 0.0. Overview

This chapter introduces the key motivations for using Python in pricing, and the advantages it offers over traditional approaches.  

Python is more than just an alternative tool for performing familiar tasks, it enables a fundamentally different approach to data analytics. By leveraging Python, pricing teams can automate repetitive processes, work with larger datasets, improve transparency, and build more robust, reproducible models.  

Throughout this chapter, weâ€™ll explore how Python can streamline workflows, support innovation in pricing strategy, and provide capabilities that are difficult or impossible with conventional tools like Excel.
