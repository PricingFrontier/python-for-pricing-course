# 1.6. Collaboration - Non Technical

While Excel spreadsheets are the most familiar example of sharing analysis with non-technical users, many other common approaches still rely heavily on manual steps or static outputs. Python opens the door to more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly collaboration methods:

## Static Reports (PDF, Word, HTML)

- Often analysts generate static reports (PDFs, Word docs, or HTML files) with key tables and charts to share with business users.
- These are usually created manually or with semi-automated scripts.
- Python libraries like `ReportLab`, `WeasyPrint`, or `python-docx` can automate generating these reports on a schedule.
- This reduces manual effort, ensures consistency, and allows quick updates with fresh data.

## Interactive Dashboards and Web Apps

- Instead of static reports, interactive dashboards let users explore the data themselves-filter by date, segment, or other dimensions.
- Tools like `Plotly Dash` enable analysts to build simple web apps without requiring users to write code.
- This greatly enhances user engagement and understanding, while freeing analysts from repetitive “ad-hoc” requests.

## Scheduled Emails with Summary Insights

- Python scripts can automatically generate key insights or alert emails based on pricing data (e.g., unusual trends, KPIs).
- Integrations with email APIs (like SendGrid) allow automated delivery to stakeholders at set intervals.
- This keeps users informed proactively without manual report distribution.

## APIs for Data Access and Integration

- Building lightweight APIs with Python (using frameworks like `FastAPI` or `Flask`) allows non-technical teams or other software systems to query pricing outputs on demand.
- This replaces emailing files or copy-pasting data and ensures everyone accesses consistent, up-to-date information.
- APIs can power internal tools, BI platforms, or third-party integrations.

## Version-Controlled Notebooks and Documentation

- Sharing Jupyter Notebooks enables users to see analysis code, results, and commentary all in one place.
- For non-technical users, notebooks can be pre-built to only show results or use widgets to interact without touching code.
- Documentation alongside notebooks clarifies assumptions and methodology.

## Data Visualizations Embedded in Presentations or Portals

- Python scripts can export high-quality charts with libraries such as `Plotly` that are easily embedded in PowerPoint or web portals.
- Automating this reduces manual chart copying and helps maintain consistency across reports.
