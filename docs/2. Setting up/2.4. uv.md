# 2.4. uv

When building projects or apps, we want to use seperate environments for any libraries used. 

This means that each project only has the libraries required, which makes deployment easier and prevents issues with different projects requiring different library versions. 

## uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is another open source tool for installing and managing python virtual environments and libraries.

Relatively new, very fast, and replaces a number of different tools: pip, venv pyenv. 

## Installing uv

Documentation found [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (look familiar?): 

=== "Windows"

    Use `irm` to download the script and execute it with `iex`:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```pwsh-session
    PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.8.8/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

=== "WSL"

    Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

    ```console
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    ```console
    wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```console
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.8.8/install.sh | sh
    ```

## Installing python with uv

Installing the latest version:

```bash
uv python install
```

Installing a specific version:

```bash

```
