# 3.2. Libraries

## What are Python Libraries?
A Python library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality so you donâ€™t have to write everything from scratch.  

The Python ecoysytsem is so vast, there is usually several libraries for each use case you might have.

## Examples

- Pyodbc - Accessing data from SQL databases
- Polars - Fast data processing and manipulation
- Statsmodels - Predictive modelling with GLMs
- Catboost - Generally the best performing GBM library
- MLFlow - Managing modelling workflows
- SHAP - Explaining machine learning models
- Plotly/Dash - Interactive data visualisation and dashboards
- Flask - Web Applications/model serving
- GreatTables - Great looking tables
- PyTorch - Matrix computation and optimisation frameworks
- Pytest - Testing code

## How to use Python Libraries

uv add {library name}

Once installed, these can be imported into our code.

```python
import polars as pl
```

This then allows the prefix pl. before any functions or objects from the polars library. This is useful to prevent any ambiguity when two libraries contain the same function names. 

```python
data = pl.read_csv('./frequency_set.csv')
```

We can also import single modules from a libary:

```python
from polars import 
```

Libraries tend to have extensive documentation with 'Getting started' guides showing some toy examples that can be adapted to you use case.
