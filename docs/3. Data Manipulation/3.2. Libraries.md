# 3.2. Libraries

## What are Python Libraries?
A Python library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality so you donâ€™t have to write everything from scratch.  

The Python ecoysytsem is so vast, there is usually several libraries for each use case you might have.

## Examples

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - Accessing data from SQL databases
- [Polars](https://pola.rs/) - Fast data processing and manipulation
- [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) - Predictive modelling with GLMs
- [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/) - Generally the best performing GBM library
- [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) - Managing modelling workflows
- [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Explaining machine learning models
- [Plotly/Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) - Interactive data visualisation and dashboards
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - Web Applications/model serving
- [GreatTables](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/articles/intro.html) - Great looking tables
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Matrix computation and optimisation frameworks
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - Testing code

## How to use Python Libraries

uv add {library name}

Once installed, these can be imported into our code.

```python
import polars as pl
```

This then allows the prefix pl. before any functions or objects from the polars library. This is useful to prevent any ambiguity when two libraries contain the same function names. 

```python
data = pl.read_csv('./frequency_set.csv')
```

We can also import single modules from a libary:

```python
from polars import 
```

Libraries tend to have extensive documentation with 'Getting started' guides showing some toy examples that can be adapted to you use case.
