# 2.3. Visual Studio Code

When writing code we need an IDE (Interactive Development Environment) to write our code in. 

Visual Studio Code is an open source editor developed by Microsoft.

It has a range of extensions to customise your environment, and interact with other tools and platforms.

## How to install Visual Studio Code

1. Head to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Download latest installer for Windows.

3. Run .exe installer and follow prompts.

## Connecting to WSL

If using WSL, find extensions in the navigation bar on the left. Search for 'WSL' and install. 

Afterwards, press CTRL+SHIFT+P, search 'WSL' and press 'WSL: Connect to WSL'

## Extensions

Initially these are the extensions that will be required:

1. Python

2. Jupyter

## Terminal

VS Code comes with an inbuild terminal, making it easier to become familiar with using it if not already.
