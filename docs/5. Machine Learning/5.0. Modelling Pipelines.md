# 5.0. Modelling Data

Modelling data should share the same pipelines across models / live environments. 

This ensured consistency across projects, and prevents the risk of small differences across. 

Data should be productionised to be automatically updated, so that modelling data is always to hand.

# Numeric fields - OHE, Indexing, CatBoost

Modelling data for machine learning has typically involved converting categorical factors to numeric, either through one hot encoding where each level creates a new column with a 1 or 0 indicator.

Other libraries support string indexing, where categorical levels are numbered. With a list of which columns are categorical passed to the models or kept in the data. 

Libraries such as CatBoost handle categorical factors without these transformations, and just require the list of which fields are categorical which can be dynamically generated.
