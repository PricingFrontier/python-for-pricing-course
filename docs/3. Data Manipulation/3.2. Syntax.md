# 3.0. Syntax

Before diving into building pricing models and analytics, it’s essential to master Python’s core programming concepts. This section introduces basic syntax, illustrated with insurance pricing examples.

# Variables and Data Types

Variables store values such as premiums, risk factors, or customer details. Python determines the data type automatically.

```python
# Example variables for an insurance policy
base_premium = 500           # integer, base premium amount in dollars
risk_factor = 1.15           # float, risk multiplier based on customer data
customer_name = "Smith"      # string, insured person's last name
has_claim_history = True     # boolean, whether customer has prior claims
```


# Basic Operations
```python
Calculate adjusted premium

adjusted_premium = base_premium * risk_factor

# Check if premium is above a threshold
is_high_risk = adjusted_premium > 600

# Logical operation to check eligibility for discount
eligible_for_discount = (not has_claim_history) and (adjusted_premium < 700)

if is_high_risk:
    print("Apply additional underwriting review")
elif eligible_for_discount:
    print("Apply loyalty discount")
else:
    print("Standard premium applies")
```


# Lists

Allows us to loop through. 

features = [
    "a",
    "b",
    "c",
    "d",
    "e"
]

Or we can create these dynamically. 

features = feature_data.columns

If we want to be doing anything repetitive

import polars as pl

# Fill nulls in X_train
for col in data.select(features).columns:
    if data.schema[col] == pl.Utf8:
        data = data.with_columns(pl.col(col).fill_null('missing'))
    else:
        data = data.with_columns(pl.col(col).fill_null(0))


# Dictionaries

dictionary = {
    "competitor_model": competitor_features,
    "instalment_model": instalment_features
}

# Control Flow - if Statements

```python
# List of customer premiums
premiums = [500, 650, 420, 700]

# Print each premium
for premium in premiums:
    print(f"Premium amount: ${premium}")
```

# Loops - for and while

```python
# Calculate total premiums collected using a while loop
total = 0
index = 0
while index < len(premiums):
    total += premiums[index]
    index += 1
print(f"Total premiums: ${total}")
```
