# 5.0. Machine Learning

Machine learning is commonplace in pricing, yet many teams still rely on duplicated pipelines, scattered model files, and deployments without fully understanding performance in a live environment.

This chapter shows how to build efficient, repeatable pipelines to prepare data, train models, and manage them in a central model registry.

Youâ€™ll also learn how to set up monitoring to track model drift, detect performance degradation, and maintain accuracy over time.
