# 0. Overview

Python is transforming the way pricing teams work. In this chapter, we’ll explore why it’s worth adopting, how it compares to traditional tools like Excel, and the role it can play in creating faster, more transparent, and more innovative pricing workflows. You’ll see how it fits into the bigger picture of pricing as a system, engineering practices, and long-term capability building.

- **[0.0. Why use Python](./0.0. Why use python.md)**:  
  Understand why Python has become the language of choice for pricing analytics. From automation and scalability to transparency and innovation, we’ll unpack the advantages that make it worth adopting across your team.

- **[0.1. Open source](./0.1. Open source.md)**:  
  Discover how Python’s open-source ecosystem puts world-class tools at your fingertips-without licensing fees. We’ll explore the benefits of community-driven development, rapid innovation, and the freedom to adapt solutions to your team’s exact needs.

- **[0.2. Reproducible Analytics](./0.2. Reproducible Analytics.md)**:  
  Pricing decisions require trust in the numbers. This section shows how Python enables reproducible workflows-so analyses can be re-run, verified, and audited at any time, reducing risk and increasing confidence.

- **[0.3. Innovation](./0.3. Innovation.md)**:  
  Innovation in pricing isn’t just about new models-it’s about creating an environment where new ideas can be tested quickly and reliably. We’ll show how Python opens the door to experimentation and faster iteration.

- **[0.4. Pricing as a System](./0.4. Pricing as a system.md)**:  
  Pricing isn’t a set of disconnected analyses-it’s an interconnected system. This section reframes pricing as a flow of data, models, and decisions, showing how Python can act as the unifying framework.

- **[0.5. Engineering Practices](./0.5. Engineering practices.md)**:  
  Learn how proven software engineering techniques-like version control, modular code, and automated testing-can transform pricing analytics from one-off scripts into maintainable, scalable solutions.

- **[0.6. Python vs Excel](./0.6. Python vs Excel.md)**:  
  Excel is familiar and powerful, but it has limits. Here, we compare Python’s capabilities with Excel’s, highlighting when and why Python delivers greater efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

- **[0.7. Use Cases](./0.7. Use cases.md)**:  
  See Python in action across real-world pricing problems-from data cleaning to predictive modelling. We’ll explore practical scenarios where Python delivers measurable business value.
