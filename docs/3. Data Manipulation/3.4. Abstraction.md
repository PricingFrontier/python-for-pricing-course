# 3.4. Abstraction

Abstraction is when we put more complex logic into functions, classes or libraries, allowing us to use a simple interface to write out code.

Rather than writing single complicated scripts, by creating functions for each task, we can simplify the overall workflow, promoting reusability across the codebase.

# Functions
```python
def calculate_premium(base, risk, claim_history):
    premium = base * risk
    if claim_history:
        premium *= 1.2  # 20% surcharge for prior claims
    return premium

# Example usage
customer_premium = calculate_premium(500, 1.15, False)
print(f"Calculated premium: ${customer_premium}")
```

# Configuration
