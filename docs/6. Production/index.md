# 6.0. Production

Notebooks are useful, but production-ready solutions deliver real value. This chapter covers how to package and deploy your work using cloud platforms, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines, moving from one-off scripts to scalable, maintainable systems.

Learn to transition pricing models into reliable production workflows, automate infrastructure with code, containerise applications for easy deployment, and implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and delivery.
