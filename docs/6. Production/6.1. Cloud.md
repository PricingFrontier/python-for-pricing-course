# 6.1. Cloud

To productionise code, the cloud is utilised, which is simply a machine rented, which we can configure, deploy code to, schedule or setup triggers. 

Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are the most popular cloud providers - however Azure is the more popular option within Insurance. 

# Compute

There are two main types of compute service, serverless and using VMs/Clusters. The main summaries are:

Cloud
Serverless:
Not much configuration required
Starts when triggered, runs code, turns off > pay for processing
Good for running small workloads
Scale easily (horizontal)
AWS Lamda/Azure Functions/Container Apps

VMs/Clusters:
Configuration is more involved
Long running applications
Pay for uptime
Azure Virtual Machines/Kubernetes Service

# Development

Develop Locally -> Repository -> Production

The two main aims should be
Ensure local environment matches cloud compute
Automate the the testing & deployment process
