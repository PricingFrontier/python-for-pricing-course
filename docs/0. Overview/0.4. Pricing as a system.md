# 0.4. Pricing as a system

Insurance pricing often grows organically. A new analysis is needed, so a spreadsheet is made.  
A regulator requests evidence, so a PDF is produced. A portfolio review is required, so another report is run.  

Over time, these one-off projects accumulate into a maze of disconnected tools, datasets, and documents.  
They might each work individually - but together, they form a fragile, hard-to-maintain landscape.

By contrast, thinking of pricing as a system changes the approach entirely.  
It shifts focus from delivering isolated outputs to building a connected, maintainable framework where every component plays a role in a larger whole.

## Avoiding standalone ad-hoc analysis

An ad-hoc approach might seem faster in the short term, but it comes with hidden costs:

- Duplication of effort - analysts rebuild similar processes for each new request.
- Inconsistency - slightly different methods and assumptions creep into each analysis.
- Lack of reproducibility - outputs can’t be regenerated without repeating the entire manual process.
- Single points of failure - if the creator leaves, knowledge of how it works disappears.

By designing processes so they can be plugged into a wider system, you reduce the risk of error, shorten delivery times, and make it easier to evolve your pricing over time.

## Pricing Architecture

Pricing architecture is the blueprint for how your pricing process works end-to-end.  
It defines:

- Data flows - where data comes from, how it’s cleaned, and how it’s made available for modelling.
- Model lifecycle - how models are trained, validated, deployed, and monitored.
- Business logic - the rules and adjustments applied outside of statistical models.
- Output delivery - how prices, reports, and diagnostics are generated and distributed.

A good architecture ensures each stage is connected, auditable, and repeatable.  
This doesn’t mean building the most complex system possible - it means making the system coherent and maintainable.

## Modular components that can be reused

At the heart of a pricing system are modular components - small, well-defined processes that can be reused in multiple contexts.  
For example:

- Data loaders that can be pointed at any dataset in a standard format.
- Feature engineering scripts that can be applied across multiple product lines.
- Model training pipelines that can work with different algorithms without rewriting everything.
- Report generators that can produce consistent outputs for different stakeholders.

Benefits of modular design:

- Reusability - the same code can be applied to different products or datasets.
- Maintainability - fixes and improvements are made in one place and used everywhere.
- Scalability - new capabilities can be added without breaking existing processes.
- Speed - building on existing modules means faster delivery for new requirements.

When pricing is built as a system - with strong architecture and modular components - the result is a faster, more reliable, and more adaptable process.  
This frees analysts to spend more time on strategy and innovation, rather than repeating the same manual tasks.
