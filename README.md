My name is Ralph and I've been using Python for the majority of my career in Pricing.

To me, it's not just a different tool to use, it's a different approach to analysis, and provides a variety of ways to step up the efficiency and quality of your pricing work.

I've written this course to share my experience of building end-to-end pricing systems with the wider industry and encourage analysts to explore the world of modern analytics.
