# 6.0. Production

Productionising code is a large step up from running code locally in terms of difficulty and skill sets required. 

It requires strong programming skills to build robust processes that handle edge cases. 

Familiarity with a cloud platform, the different services, and how these can interact. 

Experience at the coalface.

# Why productionise code?

Even if running a script seems trivial, 

- Keep on top of complex systems
- Limits context switching
- Prevents key man dependancy
- Allows for processes that involve more than a script, ie an API
- Requirement for deployment of models and prices

# Limitations

These are the main roadblocks encountered when productionising tools

- Limited choice of tools
- Permissions
- Time constraints
- Debugging
- Limited skill sets in pricing
