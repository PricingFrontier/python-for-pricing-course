# 0.2. Reproducible Analytics

Repeatable analytical pipelines are the bedrock of data analytics best practice. The concept is that if a data analytics project takes 2 weeks to put together, if the analysis needs iterating on, adapting to a similar project or simply refreshing with new data, it should be very simple to do, and should certainly not take another 2 weeks. (Analytics here can refer to building a predictive model, developing a feature in the rating algorithm, analysis for a rate change, etc).

This concept means analysis will be much clearer, structured, and follow a distinct set of steps, which as well as being far more efficient, allows for audit trails, peer review, and quality assurance which is especially important in insurance pricing, where the analysis needs to be compliant and so carries risk.

## Efficiency

A pricing team that doesnâ€™t build their analytical processes with repeatability in mind, will end up spending large amounts of time on tasks which could be zero-time or very quick to complete.

This is very common in insurance pricing teams, many analysts use closed-source software and analytical tools, along with Excel, to create analytical processes that require a lot of manual steps to repeat that often can not be done quickly and are often prone to error. The errors require time to debug and starting the process again. This results in projects taking far longer to complete, resource is stretched thin, and the backlog of projects grows.

By building with repeatability in mind, a core set of processes is developed that serve all analytical requirements, resource is spent on continuously improving the processes rather than simply running them. Over time the efficiency and capabilities of the team increase.

## Quality Assurance

By building repeatable analytical pipelines, quality assurance becomes a much simpler process, resulting in higher quality analysis and higher confidence in the conclusion.

Peer reviewing work is far easier, the process is usually clearer to follow and validate, and analysis can be easily reproduced to review the conclusions.

Testing is easier and can be incorporated into the pipeline, if the analytical pipelines is adapted to serve an additional process, the testing would remain, whereas if a separate analytical process was built rather than re-using an existing pipeline, the tests would need to rebuilt.

By having quality assurance in place, the pricing team will produce analysis that will be reliable, boosting confidence of other stakeholders.
