# 2.1a. Installing Python

Python can be downloaded https://www.python.org/. 

Usually the latest version is preferable, unless there is a particular version your company uses in which it is best to stay consistent.

When installing, make sure the add to path box is ticked.

Once installed, can be verified by opening command prompt and typing 'python'.
